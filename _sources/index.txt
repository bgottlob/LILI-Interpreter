Welcome to LILI Interpreter's documentation!
============================================

The primary goal of this project is to make LILI more intelligent when given voice commands in English. LILI currenty understands only a handful of commands, and these commands must be given the exact expected sentence structure. The LILI Interpreter makes it possible for LILI to understand an open vocabulary of words in more ambiguous sentence structures.
